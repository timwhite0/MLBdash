# MLBdash

[MLBdash](https://twhit.shinyapps.io/MLBdash/) is an R Shiny dashboard with projected standings and team statistics dating back to 1998.

- The first tab lists each team's projected wins and losses, which are the average of the projections from [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2022-playoff-odds.shtml) and [Baseball Prospectus](https://www.baseballprospectus.com/standings/).
- The second tab contains a plot of OPS+ (offensive performance) versus ERA+ (pitching performance) and assigns teams to tiers by partitioning the coordinate space of this plot.
- The third tab presents the information from the first two tabs for every season since 1998, which was the first season in which the MLB expanded to 30 teams.

The dashboard is now up to date for the 2024 season. OPS+ and ERA+ will fluctuate a lot for the next month or so, but they'll stabilize as the season progresses.
